This is a personal website for me as a photographer.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Purpose, Audience, and Goals: First off, I'd like to say that a personal photography website is a great idea, and isn't something I see made in this class very often. Your Purpose does a great job of summarizing what you want the site to do in a very short sentence - which is great. Your Audience section is also very well done, and you specified two different use cases for viewers, which is good. Your Goal is perfectly done, and also gives me an idea of what your site will look like when it's completed. providing a gallery would not only showcase the pictures you've taken - it would beautify your site and make it relitively easy to build a great looking front end to your site.

Great job on your Persona. The Attitudes and Behaviors section is a great thing to think about when creating your personal site. Your Use Case is also very well done. 

Your HTML and Directory structure is perfect.



### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your Use Case could use a little more detail. It's very well written, but seems like it cuts off too early at the ending sentence. 


#### You did a fantastic job on milestone 1. You've passed in Tier IV! You may now proceed to Milestone 2a. Keep up the good work.




## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Great job on your content strategy and wireframes! Your design is very well thought out, and I'm excited to see what you can do with the actual site. 

With any open time that you have, gather the images and other assets that you're going to use on the final developed version. This will give you more time during the actual development time to ask us questions - as I feel that your image gallery section may take a while to implement due to what you want it to do. Have you found a plugin that does this job? If not, this may require lots of custom JavaScript. Take a look at the [Flickity Slider](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/), the [Owl Carosel](http://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) or [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly. You may be able to do something like what you outlined in your wireframe using these slider tools. 

For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward.

Spend some time planning out color schemes, custom fonts, and other design features that you will be using on the site.
For custom fonts, I recommend using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

When you do begin development, you'll build your page on `index.php` directly inside your `/public_html` directory.


Great job with your HTML and Directory structure! 


### Edits &amp; Suggestions
Look into plugins/tools that you can use for your slider that can also be clicked for a popup image.



##Really nice work here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
