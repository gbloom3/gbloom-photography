This is a personal website for me as a photographer.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Purpose, Audience, and Goals: First off, I'd like to say that a personal photography website is a great idea, and isn't something I see made in this class very often. Your Purpose does a great job of summarizing what you want the site to do in a very short sentence - which is great. Your Audience section is also very well done, and you specified two different use cases for viewers, which is good. Your Goal is perfectly done, and also gives me an idea of what your site will look like when it's completed. providing a gallery would not only showcase the pictures you've taken - it would beautify your site and make it relitively easy to build a great looking front end to your site.

Great job on your Persona. The Attitudes and Behaviors section is a great thing to think about when creating your personal site. Your Use Case is also very well done. 

Your HTML and Directory structure is perfect.



### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your Use Case could use a little more detail. It's very well written, but seems like it cuts off too early at the ending sentence. 


#### You did a fantastic job on milestone 1. You've passed in Tier IV! You may now proceed to Milestone 2a. Keep up the good work.
